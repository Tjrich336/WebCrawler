WebCrawler:

Java WebCrawler that allows the insertion of any database such as "wikipedia", "reddit", etc. Upon insertion and build it will extract every present article and link from the link initially provided.

**PSA** The Crawler is preloaded with a wikipedia URL, in order to run other databases simply replace the existing URL with the link of your choice!
